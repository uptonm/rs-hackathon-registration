        HackWITus values inclusion and accessibility for all of our community
        members. We strive to foster a strong and compassionate community that
        values individual respect above all else. Nobody in our community should
        ever have to feel harassed or uncomfortable whether online or at an
        event. It is everyone’s responsibility to create this healthy
        environment.
