      <p>
        Rocket.Build Community Hackathon values inclusion and accessibility for
        all of our community members. We strive to foster a strong and
        compassionate community that values individual respect above all else.
        Nobody in our community should ever have to feel harassed or
        uncomfortable whether online or at an event. It is everyone’s
        responsibility to create this healthy environment.
